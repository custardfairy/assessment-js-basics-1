    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Implementation
// Design
// Maintain
// Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration
// Planning

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysis = "This is the second step, in which system and software requirements needed to implement the new software are determined."
const design = "In the third step, developers will create an outline for the overall application and translate this outline into a deisgn document to be used throughout the following stages of development."
const implementation = "During implementation, the design document is translated into code."
const testing = "Testing begins when the code or a section of code is completed; any bugs or defects are eliminated and developers confirm the software performs to the customer's expectations."
const maintenance = "Following testing and deployment, maintenance is requirements for any issues or bugs that may arise in production."
